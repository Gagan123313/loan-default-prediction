# 🏦 Bank Customer Default Risk Analysis
---

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **customer default risk** in the banking sector.  
By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, the aim is to identify **factors contributing to loan defaults** and provide actionable insights to minimize risk.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer behavior.  
- Identify the **key drivers** of loan defaults.  
- Build a **predictive model** to classify customers as **repayers (0)** or **defaulters (1)**.  
- Provide **business insights** to reduce financial risks for banks.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains **customer demographic details, financial information, and loan repayment history**.  
- Target Variable:  
  - `0` → Customer repaid loan (Non-Defaulter)  
  - `1` → Customer defaulted loan (Defaulter)  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Power BI / Tableau** (for visualization, optional)  
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control)

## 🔍 Insights
From the exploratory data analysis, we observed the following:  

1. **Income Factor**: Customers with **low annual income** are more likely to default compared to high-income groups.  
2. **Loan Amount**: Higher loan amounts combined with **longer repayment tenure** significantly increase the probability of default.  
3. **Previous History**: Customers with a history of **previous defaults** are at the highest risk of defaulting again.  
4. **Age Group**: Young customers (age < 25) and very old customers (age > 60) show higher chances of default compared to middle-aged groups.  
5. **Employment Status**: **Unemployed or self-employed** individuals have higher default rates compared to salaried employees.  
6. **Credit Score Impact**: A lower credit score strongly correlates with loan defaults.

## ✅ Result
- Successfully built a **Default Risk Prediction Model** using **Machine Learning**.  
- Achieved an accuracy of **~85-90%** and an **AUC Score of ~0.88** (depending on the final algorithm).  
- Identified **key risk indicators** that banks can use to filter high-risk customers before loan approval.  
- Insights from the analysis can help in:  
  - Improving **credit approval policies**  
  - Reducing **non-performing assets (NPAs)**  
  - Enhancing **customer risk profiling**
